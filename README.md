# simple_server_template
## fast! easy! clean! 

## we use js not ts in this project as fast coding is the first thing
## we don't use injection mode as easy coding and reading is the first thing
## we use flat mode 
## we don't use ORM library in this project as we think fast coding is the first thing
## we use node cluster and don't use pm2 because we think pm2 has too many configurations and can be replaced by a simpler node cluster
